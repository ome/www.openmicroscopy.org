                <p class="event-day-description">
                    We will start with a morning session of short lightning
                    talks from members of the community. Lightning talks set
                    the scene for the community priorities and requirements
                    that are the focus of the rest of the meeting. After
                    lunch, we'll continue with any extra lightning talks—
                    these have been very popular in the past, so please do
                    sign up for one and use this opportunity to present your
                    current work and your OME wishlist. These will be followed
                    by an update on OME's progress and status and a few longer
                    community talks. We'll finish the day with a poster
                    session, drinks reception and dinner.

                        If you would like to present a lightning talk, please
                        answer 'yes' during registration, send us a short
                        title by <B>Tuesday 8th May</B> and prepare a maximum
                        of five slides. Ideally the slides should be submitted
                        in advance but they can be brought to the meeting on a
                        portable memory stick.

                        asked if you would like to present a poster. If so, a
                        one-page A4 poster abstract with a short title in Word
                        or PDF format should be submitted to June Matthew by
                        <B>Tuesday 8th May</B>. We ask that you prepare and
                        bring one slide with a brief description of your
                        poster to the meeting for a short 1 minute
