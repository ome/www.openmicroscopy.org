                <p class="event-day-description">The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) is an open-source software project that develops tools that enable access, analysis, visualization, sharing and publication of biological image data. We support more than 150 image data formats across many imaging modalities including medical imaging, high-content screening and whole-slide imaging.
                We support and visualize multi-channel 3D timelapse images.
 
                OMERO, a component of OME, is a software platform for image data management and analysis which will be presented in this course. 
                Import, organisation, viewing, searching, annotation and publishing of imaging data with OMERO will be shown.
                </p>
                <p class="event-day-description">
                The 1-hour workshop concentrates on basics of OMERO and demonstrates how the OMERO platform can be integrated with tools such as CellProfiler, ImageJ, R.
