                The OME team is keen to provide outreach workshops in the community to
                demonstrate the features of our tools within imaging workflows. The training
                materials we develop are freely available along with the image data and
                setup procedures used.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content of the workshops is usually derived from materials in
                <a href="https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest">omero-guides</a>.
                New topics of workshops can also be suggested or discussed.
                The <a href="https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest">omero-guides</a> can also be used as a
                starting user manual for and introduction to OMERO concepts and capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our workshops range in length from a 1-hour overview of OMERO up to a full day.
                For more detailed coverage, a 2-day workshop can be used to provide an introduction
                to OMERO on one day and more advanced analysis, developer or sysadmin features
                on the next.
