She finished her PhD under the supervision of PD Dr. Peter Hemmerich at the Fritz-Lipmann Institute of Age Research in Jena in 2007. From 2007 to 2011 she worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Molecular Physical Chemistry Department at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, headed by Prof. Claus Seidel. She started building up the Center for Advanced Imaging (CAi) at the Heinrich Heine University of Düsseldorf (HHU) in 2011. CAi is the central imaging core facility of HHU and offers access to light and electron microscope systems, as well as support in image data management and image analysis by providing a local OMERO instance to all CAi users. Since 2021 Stefanie is the chair of board of German BioImaging e.V. – Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis and since 2023 she is the spokesperson of NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium within the framework of NFDI, the national German research data infrastructure initiative. In her free time, she enjoys sailing.",
