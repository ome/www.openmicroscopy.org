      "description": "Jason Swedlow earned a BA in Chemistry from Brandeis University in 1982. He performed his PhD in Biophysics with Profs D. A. Agard and J. W. Sedat, finishing in 1994. Dr Swedlow was a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF and then Harvard Medical School from 1994 and 1998, supported by a Damon Runyon Walter Winchell Cancer Research Fund Fellowship from 1995 to 1997. In 1998, Dr Swedlow established his own laboratory at the Wellcome Trust Biocentre, University of Dundee, Scotland as a Principal Investigator and Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellow. He was awarded a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in 2002, and named Professor of Quantitative Cell Biology in 2007. His lab focuses on studies of mitotic and interphase chromosome structure and dynamics. He is Co-Director of the Analytical and Quantitative Microscopy Course. He is co-founder of OME (along with Peter Sorger and Ilya Goldberg).",

After studying Bioinformatics at the University of Applied Sciences Weihenstephan, Freising, he worked at different places as Java Software Developer with a bit of Linux system administration. His projects mostly had a bioinformatics background (analysis of multiple sequence alignments, DNA sequence optimization) with a short side trip into the world of logistics/warehousing. In his spare time he enjoys exploring Scotland's countryside on foot, on the bicycle or on the motorbike; respectively when the days are short and the weather's bad, trying to set up the ultimate Linux system.",

Having got interested in the OME project from a user's point of view, he decided on a change of scene and left the lab to do an MSc in Applied Computing at Dundee University's School of Computing. He returned to the Swedlow lab for his MSc project. His goal was to make it easier for biologists to record their experimental metadata in a digital form. This was the start of the OMERO.editor development, which continued when he joined the lab as a developer in October 2007. His other interests include mountaineering, sailing and motorbiking.",
