                      <p>Mark Carroll joined the OME team in October 2012 as a software developer. Since graduating in computer science he has mostly worked in scientific and research computing as a software developer, system administrator, principal investigator, and technical writer. Past projects have included artificial intelligence (especially inference and planning), numerical simulation of physical systems (including sonar propagation, ligand-protein docking, and communications networks), using various programming languages (C, Perl, Java, Lisp, Haskell, and others), funded through academic institutions and the US military. At home he mostly eats, sleeps, watches television, and herds children, but hopes someday to make time for pursuits such as music, swimming, and cookery.</p>

                      <p>Dominik Lindner joined the team in Dundee as a Software Developer in February 2014. After studying Bioinformatics at the University of Applied Sciences Weihenstephan, Freising, he worked at different places as Java Software Developer with a bit of Linux system administration. His projects mostly had a bioinformatics background (analysis of multiple sequence alignments, DNA sequence optimization) with a short side trip into the world of logistics/warehousing. In his spare time he enjoys exploring Scotland's countryside on foot, on the bicycle or on the motorbike; respectively when the days are short and the weather's bad, trying to set up the ultimate Linux system.</p>

                      <p>Will Moore came to Dundee as a cell biologist to do his PhD and then joined Jason's lab as a post-doc in 2003. Having got interested in the OME project from a user's point of view, he decided on a change of scene and left the lab to do an MSc in Applied Computing at Dundee University's School of Computing. He returned to the Swedlow lab for his MSc project. His goal was to make it easier for biologists to record their experimental metadata in a digital form. This was the start of the OMERO.editor development, which continued when he joined the lab as a developer in October 2007. His other interests include mountaineering, sailing and motorbiking.</p>

When he isn't working he is busy with his children and vice versa which means there is little time left for his favorite hobbies: 'Fussball' and Tennis - but then again he's getting too old and injury-prone anyhow so that watching them on TV is the healthier option.</p>
