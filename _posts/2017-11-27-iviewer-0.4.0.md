intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.iviewer 0.4.0
---
Today we are releasing version 0.4.0 of OMERO.iviewer: an OMERO.web app
for visualizing images in OMERO. This version requires OMERO 5.4.0 or newer.

This 0.4.0 version is still a work-in-progress and some areas are likely to be
modified.

This version includes:

- display both import date and acquisition date when available
- fix configuration issue when used as the default viewer in OMERO.web
- reduce the size of the bundled javascript
- rename the control inverting the color to "invert" instead of "reverse"
- add option to export basic ROIs statistics in a CSV file
- add option to query pixels intensity
- upgrade Openlayers to version 4.3.2

For installation instructions go to
[omero-iviewer on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-iviewer/).
