Today we are releasing our version 0.2.0 of OMERO.iviewer: an OMERO.web app for 
visualizing images in OMERO. This version requires OMERO 5.3.3.

This 0.2.0 version is still work-in-progress and some areas are likely to be modified.
We have already a good number of tasks planned for our [next release](https://trello.com/b/LMngWqg2/iviewer-03).

This version includes:

* support for omero prefix
* improved manipulation of rendering setting for floating images with very small pixels range
* support for maximum intensity projection along Z
* loading ROIs using the web api
* added ability to draw lines
* improved copy and paste of ROIs and added a new context menu for these actions
* added ability to open multiple selected images
* improved layout of ROIs table
* added support for two new lookup tables from [https://www.janelia.org/](https://www.janelia.org/)
* added option to turn on or off the interpolation
