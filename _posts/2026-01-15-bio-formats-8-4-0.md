Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 8.4.0 which includes a new file format as well as several fixes and improvements.

The full list of changes included in this release are as follows:

New file formats:

* Added support for TissueGnostics TFCYTO file format, sponsored by TissueGnostics GmbH

File format fixes:

* CellH5
   - reduce memory usage
* DCIMG
   - fix indexing over multiple files (thanks to Zach Marin)
* Evident/Olympus OIR
   - fix several issues that prevented pixel blocks from being found
* Evident/Olympus VSI
   - parse timestamps for each plane if available
* FV1000
   - fix precision of ROI coordinate calculation
* Hamamatsu NDPI
    - read emission wavelength from single NDPI files
* Leica TCS
   - remove unused detector parsing logic
* LEO
    - fix tag parsing to use `iso-8859-1` encoding instead of `UTF-8`
* Metamorph
   - fix plane position parsing for multi-series data
* Nikon ND2
   - fix dimensions and timestamp assignment for certain multi-channel datasets
   - ignore invalid bits per pixel values when determining pixel type
   - prevent pixel types other than `uint8` from being set incorrectly
   - changed the plane padding for another condition to pad to 4 byte boundaries (thanks to Matthew Smith)
* OME-XML
   - fix `OriginalMetadataAnnotation` parsing to allow escaped characters
* RCPNL
   - define objective metadata for lens IDs 18113 and 18114

Bio-Formats improvements:

* bfconvert
   - automatically calculate a pyramid resolution count if `-pyramid-scale` is used without `-pyramid-resolutions`
   - prevent large values of `-pyramid-resolutions` from producing resolutions with invalid dimensions
   - fix pyramid generation when writing a subset of planes (with `-channel`, `-z`, and/or `-t`)
* ImageJ plugin
   - fix modulo C (e.g. lifetime) scrollbars
* MATLAB/Octave toolbox
   - fix array sizes in `bfGetPlane` when using Octave
* `FakeReader`
   - add `labelPlanes` attribute to include human-readable plane indexes in each image
   - link `Instrument` to every `Image`
* Add unit tests for `ChannelMerger` and `ChannelSeparator`
* Several updates to automated repository tests to eliminate invalid test failures
* Automatically generate release notes when creating a GitHub release

Component updates:

* `logback` was upgraded to 1.3.16
* `ome-common` was upgraded to 6.1.2
* `ome-codecs` was upgraded to 1.1.2
* `ome-metakit` was upgraded to 5.3.10
* `ome-model` was upgraded to 6.5.1
* `ome-poi` was upgraded to 5.3.11
* CodeQL updated to v4
