title: Release of OME Files C++ 0.4.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME Files C++ 0.4.0
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and
OME-TIFF file format for the storage and interchange of biological
imaging data and metadata.  It provides support for:

- the OME Data Model (model objects, metadata store, XSL transforms
  and XML validation)
- OME-TIFF reading
- OME-TIFF writing

The major changes in this release are the addition of tiling support
to the writer interface and the OME-TIFF writer, and the addition of
examples for use of the metadata and model API for adding extended
metadata, including annotations.

**Downloads**

The software release is available at the OME Files C++ 0.4.0 [download
page](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ome-files-cpp/0.4.0/).  This
page includes links to the individual repositories and source
releases, as well as the documentation and binary builds of the
collection for several common platforms, including Windows, Linux and
MacOS X.
