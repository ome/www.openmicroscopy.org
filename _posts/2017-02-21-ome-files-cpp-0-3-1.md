title: Release of OME-Files-C++ 0.3.1
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME-Files-C++ 0.3.1
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and OME-TIFF file format for the storage and interchange of biological imaging data and metadata.  It provides support for:

-  the OME Data Model (model objects, metadata store, XSL transforms and XML validation)
-  OME-TIFF reading
-  OME-TIFF writing

This release contains two bugfixes to correct the support for references in the data model such as ROI references in an Image.
