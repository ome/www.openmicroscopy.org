title: Release of OME Files C++ 0.3.2
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME Files C++ 0.3.2
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and OME-TIFF file format for the storage and interchange of biological imaging data and metadata. It provides support for:

-  the OME Data Model (model objects, metadata store, XSL transforms and XML validation)
-  OME-TIFF reading
-  OME-TIFF writing

This release contains a single bugfix for the Minimal TIFF writer to align its setting of the PlanarConfiguration TIFF tag with the OME-TIFF writer.

**Downloads**

This page includes links to the individual repositories and source releases, as well as the documentation and binary builds of the collection for several common platforms, including Windows, Linux and MacOS X.
