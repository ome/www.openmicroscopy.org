intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.3.4
---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.3.4, a bug fix release which includes the following changes:

Bug fixes:

-  ImageJ
    -  fix for a NullPointerException when exporting images that were not opened via the Bio-Formats importer, and thus do not have a complete OMEXMLMetadata store
-  Java 1.9
    -  fix compile and runtime errors to enable building with Java 1.9

File format support:

-  ECAT7
    -  update to add support for different versions of ECAT7 files (thanks to Torsten Stöter)

Updated build system:

-  updated dependency for ome-model in the POM to version 5.4.0. This allows for improved ROI handling by enabling support for Shape objects with Transform attributes. OME-XML schema version remains unchanged as OME schema 2016-06

Documentation improvements:

-  new public sample files added for ECAT7 (thanks to Torsten Stöter)
-  new public sample files added for Leica LIF (thanks to Michael Goelzer)
-  new specification document (Version 3.2) for Leica LIF
-  updated links to OMERO documentation as a result of decoupling

The software is available to download now and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users ([archived downloads](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.4))
