intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.7.2
---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.7.2 which includes the following changes:

File format fixes and improvements:

* Nikon ND2
    * fixed a bug which would use the incorrect channel count for small-sized
      single channel images

* MetaMorph TIFF
    * changed the reader's behaviour to populate exposure times for all planes
      when only a single exposure time is defined

* DeltaVision
    * improved parsing of the associated log files to add additional key value 
      pairs to global metadata

* EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)
    * fixed an exception when reading pixel data in cases with embedded TIFF

* GIF
    * fixed a bug to display the correct data when reading planes out of order

Bug fixes and improvements:

* fixed failures with Ant build from a clean Maven repository by updating
  Maven repositories to use HTTPS rather than HTTP
* now using safe version checking for Bio-Formats plugins to prevent a bug
  with Java 9
* updated the JPEG-XR codec to allow either interleaved or non-interleaved
  data to be returned

Documentation improvements:

* added clarification regarding Bio-Formats version requirements for using
  Java 7 or above
* updated download links to latest Bio-Formats release version
* updated the link to the most active fork of JAI ImageIO
* fixed a number of external broken links
* added a Trello link for contributing external developers
* added a link to [Adding format/reader documentation pages](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/developers/format-documentation.html)
  to help those contributing to the documentation or supported formats pages
* the [Bio-Rad Gel page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/formats/bio-rad-gel.html) has been updated to add a link to biorad1sc_reader, an
  external python implementation (thanks to Matthew Clapp)

Full details can be found at [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.2/about/whats-new.html).
