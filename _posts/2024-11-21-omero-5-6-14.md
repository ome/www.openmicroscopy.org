intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.server 5.6.14
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.14 which includes:

- The  various Java components e.g. ``omero-server`` have been built via Java 11 with the compatibility flag on for Java 8.
Due to limited testing on Java 8, we recommend to upgrade to Java 11 or higher.
- Addition of new lookup tables.
- Upgrade of Bio-Formats to version 8.0.1.

**Note:** This upgrade will invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please see the upgrade guide for further information.

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes included in the OMERO 5.6 series see the
