title: Launch of new OME website
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the launch of the new website
---

We are excited to launch the new, completely rebuilt and redesigned OME 
website. The new website is available at the URL you all know so well:
[https://www.openmicroscopy.org](https://www.openmicroscopy.org).

The updated site includes a full redesign of the styling and improved
experience for mobile and tablets. The main content has been reorganized to be
more intuitive with the information streamlined towards our target audience:
scientists, developers and institutions.

The content of the previous website remains accessible under a
[legacy domain](https://www-legacy.openmicroscopy.org). Most of the legacy
URLs whose content have not been migrated to the new website should be
redirected to this legacy domain.

Any issue or question, do not hesitate to contact us via the
[forums or mailing-lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
