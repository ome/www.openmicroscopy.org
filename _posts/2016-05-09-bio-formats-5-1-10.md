Dear All,

Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.1.10, a bug-fix release.

This release is primarily aimed at fixing warnings being thrown by Bio-Formats for ImageJ and other non-FIJI users on Windows. These warnings have been triggered by the removal of the 3i Slidebook DLLs from the source code repository in Bio-Formats 5.1.9 and should now only be triggered when opening Slidebook files without the update site enabled [1].

This release also includes a couple of other bug-fixes:

* a fix in the ImageJ plugin for files grouped using the "Dimensions" option
* a fix for writing TIFF files in tiles

The software is available at: [archived downloads](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.1.10/)

Any problems or comments, please use the OME Forums or mailing lists:

Regards,

The OME Team
