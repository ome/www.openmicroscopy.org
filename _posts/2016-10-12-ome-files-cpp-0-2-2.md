title: Release of OME-Files-C++ 0.2.2
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME-Files-C++ 0.2.2
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and OME-TIFF
file format for the storage and interchange of biological imaging data and
metadata. It provides support for:

-   The OME Data Model (model objects, metadatastore, XSL transforms and XML
    validation)
-   OME-TIFF reader
-   OME-TIFF writer

The major focus of this release is to extend the support for features in older
OME-XML model versions and to improve the support for automated testing all
OME-XML and OME-TIFF features.  This will continue for the following release.

Major changes in this release include:

-   OME-TIFF reader and writer updates

**Errata**

Support for building on Windows with *msbuild* is currently non-functional;
please use *Ninja* for the time being.

On Windows, "ome-files info" will display an error if run from a directory
containing a space in it. As a workaround, use "libexec\ome\files\info.exe"
directly.
