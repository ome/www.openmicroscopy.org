- ImageJ plugin insight-ij: improve saving of ROIs and Measurements

- server: do not set the trustStore properties if empty
- cli: improve logging of error when importing data via cli command
- cli: clearly indicate empty log files when running a diagnostic
- cli: fix bug when running `config load` passing a directory instead of a file
- cli: add option to delete keys from map annotations

Developer improvements include:
