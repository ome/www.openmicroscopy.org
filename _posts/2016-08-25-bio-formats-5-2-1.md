intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.2.1
---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.2.1, a bug-fix release. 

Improvements include fixes for two formats:

*  Zeiss CZI
    -  fixed NumberFormatException when the position object is not null but the values of child are null
*  SimplePCI
    -  made IniParser less stringent to allow reading of imperfectly formatted TIFF description headers

Other improvements:

*  fixed stitching of file patterns in ImageJ to remove duplication of directory names in the file path
*  added an option to bfconvert to allow creation of OME-TIFF without lookup tables
*  addition of MetadataOnly elements containing no BinData or TiffData now handled via MetadataTools API in ImageInfo
*  example code in developer docs is now tested via a new Maven module

Full details can be found at [Bio-Formats version history](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.2/about/whats-new.html)
