Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.1, a bug-fix release focusing on improving our installation documentation and workflows. Other improvements include:

-  bug fix for missing hierarchy when viewing High Content Screening data
-  improvements to the right-hand panel in OMERO.insight
-  measurement tool fixes
-  OMERO.web fix for displaying size units

Users of the insight-ij plugin in Fiji should note that some versions of Java are failing to allow the plugin to connect to OMERO. Please refer to our [help guide](http://help.openmicroscopy.org/imagej.html) and try a different version of Java if possible.

Developer updates include:

-  OMERO Javadocs now link to the relevant version of Bio-Formats Javadocs for inherited methods
-  clean-up of server dependencies
-  jstree clean-up
-  CLI graph operation improvements for deleting
-  minimal-omero-client and pom-omero-client clean-up

System administrator updates include:

-  improved installation documentation, including an updated and tested complete walkthrough for installation on CentOS 6
-  OMERO.web deployment fixes
