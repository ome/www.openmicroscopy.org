Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.3.2, a bug fix release:

     - updated thumbnail generation to be faster for datasets containing an image pyramid
- Metamorph
     - updated to read the refractive index and set RefractiveIndex on ObjectiveSettings in the generated OME-XML (thanks to Marc Bruce)
- Metamorph TIFF
     - fixed Z and channel dimension counts when each channel has a unique Z position
     - updated to read the emission wavelength and set EmissionWavelength on LightSourceSettings in the generated OME-XML
- QuickTime
     - fixed incorrect image data when reading of tiles from single channel files
- file grouping
     - fixed handling of loci.formats.in.MetadataOptions objects by the loci.formats.FileStitcher reader
