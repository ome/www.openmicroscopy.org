We are pleased to announce that the 13th Annual OME Users Meeting will be held
May 30th - June 1st 2018 in Dundee.

We are working on the [programme]({{site.baseurl}}/events/13th-annual-users-meeting-2018.html) and
will aim to release this in the next few of weeks. We'll also post
registration and accommodation details as soon as possible.

The format will be similar to last year with a day of talks from the community
and invited speakers, followed by a day of workshops, and a final more
informal day for discussions and collaborations. If you’ve never joined us
before, you can find recent programmes in the
[Events section]({{site.baseurl}}/events/) to give you an idea of what to
expect.

Dundee is a hot destination in 2018
(one of [CNN's 'Coolest 7 cities to look out for in 2018'](http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/cities-to-watch-in-2018/index.html)
no less) so come join us for a packed programme and no doubt some social fun
too!
