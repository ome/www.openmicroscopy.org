Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.2, a bug-fix release.

Improvements include:

* added documentation on a complete workflow for
  [publishing data from OMERO.server](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/sysadmins/public.html)
* added references to the new
  [OMERO pyramid format documentation](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/ome-model/omero-pyramid/index.html)
  (within the OME Data Model and File Formats documentation)
* faster loading of thumbnails for large Plates after a recent regression
* made projecting images belonging to another user only possible for users
  with the required permissions to save the new images
* improved the public user experience for password-less access
* updated SwingX library version used by OMERO.insight to stop insight-ij
  plugin crashing in Fiji
* CLI updates:
  * ``import --target`` into a container without the necessary permissions 
    now fails before file upload starts and more transparently
  * ``admin mail`` timeout is now configurable via ``--wait``
  * added ``admin log`` command for inserting statements to the server log

Sysadmin changes include:

  upgrade

* improved Slice documentation for API deprecations
* added instructions to
  [documentation for OMERO.cli extensions](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/developers/cli/extending.html)
  on how to create CLI plugins that are ``pip`` installable
* substantial effort to make third-party repositories easily testable;
