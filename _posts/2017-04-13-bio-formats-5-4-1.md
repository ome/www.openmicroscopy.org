Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.4.1 which includes the following changes:

File format improvements:

* MIAS (Maia Scientific)
    * added a fix for a possible exception when image files are not found under channel-specific subdirectories
* BD Pathway
    * added fix to check if Experiment.exp is a directory or an experiment file
* Imspector OBF
    * enabled forward compatibility for future versions as the OBF format is backwards compatible (thanks to Bjoern Thiel)

Documentation improvements:

* updated external homepage link for FocalPoint
* removed Imago from list of visualization and analysis applications as it is no longer available from the Mayachitra website
* added links to public sample files for Hamamatsu NDPI and Hamamatsu VMS (see [http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/))
