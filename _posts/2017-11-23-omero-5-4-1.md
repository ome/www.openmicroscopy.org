title: Release of OMERO 5.4.1
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.4.1.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.1, a bug-fix release.

Improvements include:

* labelled zoom slider bars in the UI to differentiate from horizontal
  scrollbars and make clear thumbnails can be zoomed (including Plate and
  Well thumbnails)
* fixes for installation walkthrough documentation - installation of script
  dependencies and gunicorn, and clarification of which user account to use
  for ``pip install`` actions
* fixed checking of "guest" user
* update to fetch third-party artifacts over https to allow OMERO to build
  even without a local Maven cache already populated
* added ``javax.activation`` dependency to allow OMERO.insight to work with
  Java 9
* import of files reporting extreme pixel sizes now fail rather than hanging
* pyramid-making now aborts when a tile fails
* various test fixes
* CLI fixes:
  * improved help output for graphs commands to make it clearer that
    ``--include`` and ``--exclude`` expect class names not object IDs
  * allowed setting the ``OMERO_PASSWORD`` environment variable instead of
    using the ``-w`` command-line option
  * made passwords hidden by default when running ``omero config get``
  * fixed the CLI metadata tablestest plugin to not use an empty list of
    Columns

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to
[5.7.2](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.2/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.1).
